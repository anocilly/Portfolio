My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University in the College of Engineering. I am intending on majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in aerospace and also have an interest in business and social sciences.
Beyond academics, in my free time, I like to read, watch soccer, and play videogames. I have extensive teamwork, leadership experience, and job experience developed through tutoring, childcare positions, refereeing, and athletics.
